# Star Journey

Star Journey is an interactive viewport to the solar system and beyond. The large circle in the center of your screen represents 180 degrees of vision, and all of the objects you see within it are sized accordingly based on your distance to them.
For example, from Earth, the moon appears to have an angular diameter of 0.5 degrees on average. This means that if you move to the location of the Earth within Star Journey, the moon will appear to have 1/360th the diameter of your viewport.

## Controls

### Updating Direction

You can update the direction you are facing in three ways. The first is that you can use the control buttons, which will rotate you 5 degrees in the direction that you press. The second is by updating your rotation manually in the Viewport Rotation section, above the control buttons.
Finally, you can also click on an object in the viewport, and it will automatically center on that object.

### Updating Position

Currently, you can update your position with the Viewport Position controls to the right of the viewport. The program uses a 3d cartesian coordinate system with an x, y, and z axis, with our sun at the origin point.
One unit of distance is equal to one mile.

### Jumping

You can also update your position by "jumping" forward using the jump button. To control the distance that you jump, update the value in the jump distance input box.
